# **Contributing to HelloSign Developer Samples**

The Dropbox Platform team welcomes contributions of all kinds, from simple bug reports to README improvements, bug fixes, code improvement, and new features being added to existing samples.

## **DOs and DON'Ts**
- Do sign the Dropbox CLA located here: [https://opensource.dropbox.com/cla/](https://opensource.dropbox.com/cla/)
- DO give priority to the current style of the project or file you're changing
- DO keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new issue than to side track the discussion.
- DONâ€™T send PRs for style changes.
- DON'T surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
- DON'T commit code that you didn't write. If you find code that you think is a good fit, file an issue and start a discussion before proceeding.
- DON'T submit PRs that alter licensing related files or headers. If you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be happy to discuss it.
## **Workflow**

We love Github issues! Before working on any new features, please open an issue so that we can agree on the direction, and hopefully avoid investing a lot of time on a feature that might need reworking.
Small pull requests for things like typos, bugfixes, etc are always welcome.
Please note that we will not accept pull requests for style changes.
