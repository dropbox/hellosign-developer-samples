# Embed a CLA Signing Page Using NodeJS with the HelloSign and GitHub APIs
When developers are contributing to an open source project, it's common practice for them to sign a Contributors License Agreement (known as a CLA). A CLA lays out simple rules to ensure the contributor has the rights to use the code being incorporated as well as adherence to particular style or policies.

The code in this repo shows one of the multiple ways to facilitate this process by implementing a CLA signing flow embedded in a webpage using the developerâ€™s GitHub identity and the [embedded signing](https://app.hellosign.com/api/embeddedSigningWalkthrough) capability of the [HelloSign API](https://www.hellosign.com/products/api).

The details of this implementation can be found in [this blogpost](https://www.hellosign.com/blog/embed-a-cla-signing-page-using-nodejs-with-the-hellosign-and-github-apis), as well as instructions to simply run the code with the required configuration on HelloSign and GitHub.
